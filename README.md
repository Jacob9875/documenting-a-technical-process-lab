# Installing Random Access Memory

To install Random Access Memory, power down your computer, unplug it, open the case, and locate the memory slots on the motherboard. Align the notch on the Random Access Memory stick with the slot, press firmly until the latches click into place, then close the case and reboot. The system should automatically recognize the new memory. The purpose of installing Random Access Memory is to increase a computer's speed and ability to multitask by providing faster temporary storage for data that the Central Processing Unit needs to access.

## Prerequisites 

- **Confirm compatibility** — Verify the correct Random Access Memory type (DDR3/DDR4/DDR5), speed, capacity, and maximum supported memory for your motherboard or laptop.

- **Obtain the correct RAM modules** — Purchase modules that match your system’s requirements and intended configuration.

- **Have basic tools ready** — Typically a Phillips screwdriver for opening the case or access panel.

- **Power down the system** — Shut down the computer completely and unplug it from all power sources.

- **Prepare an anti-static environment** — Ideally use an anti-static wrist strap or periodically touch a grounded metal surface to prevent electrostatic discharge.

- **Clear a clean workspace** — Ensure you have room to safely open the machine and handle components without dust or clutter.

## Key Terms

- **Random Access Memory or RAM** - is a type of computer memory that stores data for fast, temporary access. It is the workspace where the operating system and applications run, and it allows the CPU to quickly read and write data needed for active tasks. The amount of RAM can impact a device's performance, especially its ability to handle multiple tasks at once. 

- **Central Processing Unit or CPU** - is the "brain" of a computer that executes instructions from programs and processes data.

- **Electro Static Discharge** - is the sudden flow of static electricity between two objects with different electric potentials, often occurring when they come into contact or close proximity. 

- **Motherboard** - is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in a computer that connects all its internal components, such as the CPU, RAM, and storage drives.

- **Overclocking** - is the process of running your computer's random access memory at a higher speed (frequency) than its factory default settings, which can improve system performance. 

- **BIOS** - stands for Basic Input/Output System, which is the firmware on a computer's motherboard that initializes hardware and boots the operating system.

## Steps to installing Random Access Memory

1. **Check your system specifications** — Look up your motherboard or laptop model to determine supported Random Access Memory type (e.g., DDR4, DDR5), maximum capacity, and supported speeds.

2. **Identify current Random Access Memory configuration** — Confirm how many slots you have, how many are occupied, and what capacity/speed your existing modules use.

3. **Determine upgrade needs** — Decide whether to add more Random Access Memory, replace existing modules, or match new Random Access Memory to current sticks for compatibility.

4. **Purchase compatible Random Access Memory** — Choose Random Access Memory that matches the required type, speed, voltage, and capacity for your system.

5. **Power down and unplug the computer** — Shut down completely and disconnect all cables.

6. **Open the case or access panel** — Remove the side panel on a desktop or bottom cover on a laptop.

7. **Ground yourself** — Touch a metal surface or use an anti-static strap to prevent electrostatic discharge.

8. **Locate the Random Access Memory slots** — Find the motherboard’s Dual In-line Memory Module slots (desktop) or Small Outline-Dual In-line Memory Module slots (laptop).

9. **Remove old Random Access Memory** (if needed) — Release the latches at each end and pull the module out carefully.

10. **Install the new Random Access Memory** — Align the notch on the Random Access Memory module with the slot, insert firmly, and press until both latches click into place. *Important* you may need to apply a little force to get the stick to go in completely. Do not apply force if the stick is not properly seated. 

11. **Reassemble the system** — Close the case or reattach the access panel.

12. **Reconnect power and boot the system** — Turn on the computer; it should automatically detect the new memory.

13. **Verify installation** — Check system settings or BIOS to confirm the correct amount of Random Access Memory is recognized. *Important* You may need to enter your BIOS to activate certain settings for Random Access Memory.

### Troubleshooting Steps and Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Random Access Memory may be difficult to remove or seat properly** :

- If the Random Access Memory sticks are tough to get in, then make sure you have them properly aligned. The sticks will only fit one direction. They line up only one way using the space in the near middle of the stick for alignment with the space in the Dual In-line Memory Module for desktop or Small Outline Dual In-line Memory Module for a Laptop. For Random Access Memory installation you usually want hear a click that varifies the Random Access Memory is seated correctly or the tab is fully compressed over the edge of the stick. 

- If you cannot remove the stick(s) make sure your tabs are fully compressed down on the edges. The tabs usually release the Random Access Memory stick slightly upwards for easier removal.

- *Important* Laptop Random Access Memory sticks are usually inserted at a 45 degree angle and then laid flat. They may sit on top of each other. To remove Random Access Memory from a laptop usually involves removing the sticks at about a 30 degree angle.

- **Overclocking** :

- You may need to Overclock your Random Access Memory in the BIOS to achieve advertised performance of your Random Access Memory. 

- To enable Random Access Memory overclocking in BIOS, restart your PC and enter the BIOS setup by hitting the appropriate key when prompted, then find the overclocking or memory settings section and enable the XMP (or DOCP/EXPO) profile. Save the changes and exit, and the BIOS will automatically apply the overclocked settings from your RAM's profile.
